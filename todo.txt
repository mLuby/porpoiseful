FEATURES
q@mluby.com tasks email
q.mluby.com mobile site
√ use firebase to start, maybe switch to sqlaas?
goal: keep today tasks small and accomplishable.
  √ create task — set prop(s): title completed

  √ list tasks

  _ update task — set 1 prop

  _ set repeating tasks daily

  _ can email tasks to self to be added to unsorted section
    forward to q@mluby.com
    first line of forward is settings
    if any way to auto-st url to original email in gmail that'd be great
    make both address and settings easy to type on mobile
      .name. schedule doctor appointment. oh and more... .snooze. 1 day .priority.high.needs.123
      use regex (?:\.([a-z]+)\.(.+?)(?=(?:\.[a-z]+\.)|\n)) for each match, key = match capture 1 value = match capture 2 https://regex101.com/r/ZwgZTz/1

  _ set multiple tags for tasks
    use as projects for now
  _ list tasks by tag

  _ easily accessible resources to complete task: notes, urls, emails, uploaded files

  _ defer/snooze tasks
    have quick options: tomorrow, weekend, next week, least busy in next 7 days
      if deadline, usually it's some arbitrary time before deadline (1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month)

    I like that asana lets me store tasks in the future and they return when relevant
    though if something isn't time-based it may never return.
    maybe "you haven't done anything w tag X in a while" reminder

  _ want to complete one thing and have next unblocked dependencies added to my list (today? tomorrow?)
    most tasks (esp repeats) do not have dependencies
  _ break down/expand tasks instead of completing.
    add children rather than replacing parent task
    create big task then create blockers (rather than creating blockers and then parent tasks)

  _ async mark task pending (responses, time, tasks)
    if response, enter time likely to have heard back (polling) eventually can search comms (push/stream)
    "Do you want me to ask if there's a response every day/2 days/week/month/quarter?"

  √ import from asana csv
    does not include recurrence info or attachments
    Task ID,Created At,Completed At,Last Modified,Name,Assignee,Due Date,Tags,Notes,Projects,Parent Task
